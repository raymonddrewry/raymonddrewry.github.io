I can attribute most of who I am today to my parents James and Christina Drewry. Without them I would not have had the opportunities I have today. I was born and raised in Colonial Heights. 

I am a follower of Christ who is seeking truth. I am largely involved with my campus ministry, BCM, where we study the Christian Bible and share in Christian communtity. I have served as connection leader and I am currently serving as a discipleship leader.
