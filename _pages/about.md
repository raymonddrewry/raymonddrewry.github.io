My Work Experience...
======
I can attribute most of who I am today to my parents James and Christina Drewry. Without them I would not have had the opportunities I have today.


My Education...
======
I went to Colonial Heights High School

My faith in Christ...
======
I am a follower of Christ who is seeking truth. I am largely involved with my campus ministry, BCM, where we study the Christian Bible and share in Christian communtity. I have served as connection leader and I am currently serving as a discipleship leader.
